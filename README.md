This project demonstrates how to build a dimmable RGB LED controller using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) with a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The brightness of each LED color (red, green, blue) is controlled via user input over USB serial, allowing real-time adjustments of each channel's duty cycle.

The main objective of this project is to develop a clear understanding of how PWM controls LED brightness by adjusting the duty cycle, and to gain hands-on experience using the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK within Visual Studio Code, supported by the official Pico extension.
